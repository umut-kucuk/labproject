			<h4 id="prototype">A brief history of the coffee</h4>
				<p id="intro">"The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen." The Yemenis began to cultivate coffee beans by obtaining them from Ethiopia. "By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe." Coffee has spread all over the world and has become one of the most popular beverages. Today, coffee continues to be consumed in different ways with hundreds of different types and continues to exist as an important trade item in almost every country of the world with a serious market volume.</p>
				
				<h5>Why Coffee?</h5>
					<p>The truth behind the choice of the coffee as the theme of the project is the issue of resource limitations. In order to demonstrate the ability of exploiting the technologies that have been discussed and practiced during the courses a main theme has been defined and a moka pot was chosen for the 3D design.</p>
				<h5>Scope and the Process</h5>
					<p>This project has been implemented as a toy project in which the use of technologies learned in lessons is demonstrated with examples. It could be developed in the future as part of a larger fun-learning project. The main project imagined in this context would be: A digital environment that shows and edutains the domestic user who is interested in coffee, about the entire process of coffee (from cultivation to consumption) with 3D objects and environment.
						In this created virtual environment, a wide range of information can be transferred to the users, from the cultivation of coffee to its processing, from its storage to its transportation to the end user, and to different preparation methods, with an entertaining educational method.</p>

						<p><b>Photogrametry by Zephyr 2D to 3D</b><p>
							<p>Zephyr is a program for performing photogrammetry. It is used for creating 3D objects from the images. 3DF Zephyr allows you to reconstruct 3D models from photos automatically. There are three main phases in Zephyr:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Starting a new project and defining the camera pose - this is also referred as
										'Structure from Motion'</li>
									<li>Generating 3D model: Extracting a Dense Point Cloud, Extracting a Surface</li>
									<li>Extracting a Textured Mesh</li>
								  </ol>
							<p>Extracting a Textured Mesh When starting a new project the software will extract the camera external parameters (positions and orientations) and their internal parameters (i.e. the focal length and other camera properties).</p>

						<p><b>Photogrametry by Zephyr 3D Model</b><p>
							<p>After the cameras have been oriented, you can proceed and generate the 3d model. This step goes through two phases : - Extract a dense reconstruction. The process requires the input cameras to be correct. If you believe a camera is not correctly oriented, you can remove it from the workspace. Before proceeding you can also restrict or expand the volume of reconstruction. The densification stage is managed by Stasia, our Multi-View Stereo technology, powers the reconstruction process. You can create different dense reconstructions (with varying parameters) and save them into the workspace. - Create a triangular mesh, starting from a dense reconstruction. Based on what you are going to reconstruct you can choose from either the generation of a smoothed surface (when dealing with human body or terrains for instance) or the generation of a sharp surface that more benefits scenes such as buildings or mechanical parts. The latter kind of surfaces are handled by Sasha, the meshing algorithm developed by 3Dflow. Every mesh polygon gets textured using the most appropriate pictures according to their visibility and quality. Within the texture generation phase there is a color balance algorithm as well, that allows the user to select and set-up the best color for each pixel automatically by checking the different lighting changes on the photos.</p>

					  <p>Access to image-based resources is fundamental to research, scholarship and the transmission of cultural knowledge. Digital images are a container for much of the information content in the Web-based delivery of images, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials. Yet much of the Internet’s image-based resources are locked up in silos, with access restricted to bespoke, locally built applications. A growing community of the world’s leading research libraries and image repositories have embarked on an effort to collaboratively produce an interoperable technology and community framework for image delivery.</p>
